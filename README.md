# Compare and contrast classification models in the PySpark library

# A common application for NLP in Healthcare could be classifying clinical notes into categories. As a use case, we want to classify patient clinical notes from an EHR system into two buckets: patients who are at risk for developing Sepsis and those who are not. While learning about NLP classification models, we wanted to analyze which models would work best for our use case. In this project we are attempting to compare and contrast various classification models in the PySpark library.

# We acquired a dataset of over 5,000 EHR Clinical Notes as our training dataset. These notes were classified as "include for Sepsis review" and "exclude for Sepsis review".

# We used PySpark documentation to program and evaluate various classification models in PySpark. Our goal was to evaluate models for accuracy, processing time and ease of implementation.

# Technologies used - PySpark, Python/Pandas, Flask, HTML, CSS, Javascript, Plotly

# Run our Flask app to view results of our analysis
